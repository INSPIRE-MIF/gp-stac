# How to report a deployment example

To report a deployment example, please follow the instructions below:

*   Fork the **gp-stac** repository. (For guidance, see "[Working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks)").
*   In the **deployments** folder of the forked repository, create a new Markdown (_.md_) file. (For guidance, see "[Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)").
*   Structure your file according to the [deployment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-stac/refs/heads/main/deployment-template/deployment-template.md). (You can copy/paste Markdown code blocks directly from the template).
*   Edit the file and commit your changes. (For guidance on Markdown syntax, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)"). 
*   Submit a pull request to the gp-stac repository. (For guidance, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)").

Use the [_Issue tracker_](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-stac/issues/new) to report any issues with this procedure and/or ask for support.
